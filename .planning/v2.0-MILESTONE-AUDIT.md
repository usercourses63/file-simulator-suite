## Cross-Phase Integration

### Critical Integration Points

| Integration Point | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Backend → Dashboard SignalR | 5 hubs | 5 hubs connected | ✅ VERIFIED |
| FileWatcher → Dashboard | File events propagate | Events display in feed | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Metrics → Dashboard | SQLite data shows in charts | Sparklines + History tab | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Kafka → Dashboard | Topic CRUD and message viewing | KafkaTab functional | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Dynamic Servers → ConfigMap | Updates service discovery | ConfigMapUpdateService wired | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Alerts → Dashboard | Toast + banner notifications | useAlerts + AlertToaster | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Dashboard → Production | Containerized, accessible | Helm + NodePort | ✅ VERIFIED |
| API → TestConsole | /api/connection-info | ConnectionInfoController | ✅ VERIFIED |

### API Endpoint Coverage

All 32 REST endpoints have frontend consumers:
- Server management: 6 endpoints → useServerManagement
- File operations: 4 endpoints → useFileOperations
- Kafka operations: 6 endpoints → useKafka
- Alert operations: 2 endpoints → useAlerts
- Configuration: 4 endpoints → useConfigExport
- Metrics: 2 endpoints → useMetrics
- Health/Discovery: 8 endpoints → various consumers

### SignalR Hub Wiring

| Hub | Server Method | Frontend Subscriber | Status |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| ServerStatusHub | BroadcastStatus | useSignalR | ✅ MATCHED |
| FileEventsHub | BroadcastFileEvent | useFileEvents | ✅ MATCHED |
| MetricsHub | BroadcastMetrics | useMetricsStream | ✅ MATCHED |
| KafkaHub | TopicCreated/Deleted | useKafkaStream | ✅ MATCHED |
| AlertHub | AlertTriggered/Resolved | useAlertStream | ✅ MATCHED |

## E2E User Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Server Monitoring ✅
```
ServerStatusBroadcaster → ServerStatusHub → useSignalR → ServerGrid → ServerDetailsPanel
```

### Flow 2: File Upload ✅
```
FileUploader → /api/files/upload → FileWatcher → FileEventsHub → FileEventFeed
```

### Flow 3: Dynamic Server Creation ✅
```
CreateServerModal → /api/servers → K8s Deployment → ConfigMap → SignalR → ServerGrid
```

### Flow 4: Kafka Topic Management ✅
```
KafkaTab → /api/kafka/topics → KafkaAdminService → KafkaHub → TopicList
```

### Flow 5: Alert Notification ✅
```
AlertService → AlertHub → useAlertStream → AlertToaster → AlertBanner
```

### Flow 6: Configuration Export/Import ✅
```
SettingsPanel → /api/configuration/export → ImportConfigDialog → Validation → Import
```

## Production Readiness

### Deployment Status

| Component | Status | Access |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Control API | Containerized | http://file-simulator.local:30500 |
| Dashboard | Containerized | http://file-simulator.local:30080 |
| Kafka | Running | file-simulator.local:30093 |
| All Protocol Servers | Running | Various NodePorts |

### Security Posture

- ✅ RBAC ServiceAccount with minimal permissions
- ✅ Non-root containers
- ✅ Read-only root filesystems where possible
- ✅ Dropped capabilities

### Observability

- ✅ Health check endpoints for all services
- ✅ Historical metrics with 7-day retention
- ✅ Real-time event streaming
- ✅ Alert history logging
